# Simple Drum Kit - JavaScript DOM Manipulation 🔊

## 💡 Overview

This is an interactive web-based drum kit that allows users to play drum sounds by clicking the on-screen buttons or by pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** For the structure and styling of the drum pad interface.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Used exclusively for all interactivity and logic (no external libraries like jQuery).
* **Web Audio API:** For triggering immediate sound playback when buttons are pressed.

## ✨ Implementation Highlights
This project demonstrates core competencies in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) and handling user events:

* **Keyboard Event Listeners:** Implemented listeners to detect `keypress` events (e.g., 'w', 'a', 's', 'd') and map them instantly to the correct drum sounds and visual animations.
* **Mouse Click Event Listeners:** Used loop structures to attach individual click listeners to each drum button.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically added and removed CSS classes (like a `.pressed` class) to provide visual feedback when a drum is struck.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Ensured clean separation between structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript).

## 🚀 How to Play
1.  Open the web application.
2.  **Click** on any of the drum buttons with your mouse.
3.  **Press** the corresponding key on your keyboard (W, A, S, D, J, K, L).
